## Folder Structure (Example)
/templates  
  /restaurant1  
  /school1  
  /restaurant1  
  /portfolio1  

The website type should form the base name of the folder, for example "school" for a school website. Followed by the latest available number acting as a template count for that website type. That makes a new template folder adopt a name like "portfolio3"

Each template should include:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js (if needed)
- A short description in a README.md inside the folder (optional but recommended)

### Guidelines
- Avoid copyrighted assets unless you own or license them
- Use open-source fonts and icons where possible
- Keep designs responsive and mobile-friendly
- Do not include malicious or tracking scripts
